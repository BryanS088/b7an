My team and I decided to build this vehicle not only because we are incredibly proud of what we've accomplished, but also because it motivates us to continue pursuing our dreams as engineers. Since this is our first time working on a project of this scale, we can genuinely say it was a wonderful and enriching experience.

We constructed the vehicle using materials that were already available at our school, which allowed us to make the most of the resources we had. However, we also had to supplement these with some additional materials we purchased from Amazon. Every weekday, we would meet after school to work on improving the vehicle bit by bit, refining our approach as we went along.

There were definitely challenges along the way. One of the biggest difficulties we faced was not being able to find the parts we needed when we needed them, which slowed down our progress. Additionally, we didnâ€™t have as much time as we would have liked to perfect and practice with the vehicle. Being a small team and this being our first year participating in a competition of this kind, we had a lot to learn in a short amount of time.

The materials we used included:

Pixy Cam2
Breadboard
BTN7960 motor driver
DC Motor
10kg Servo Motor
7.4v LiPo Battery
Switch
Button
Ultrasonic Sensor
Arduino Mega
In this competition, our goals go beyond just having a good time and gaining valuable experience. We also aspire to advance to the nationals, where we hope to represent our beautiful country, Panama, with pride.
