My team and I decided to build this vehicle not only because we are incredibly proud of what we've accomplished, but also because it motivates us to continue pursuing our dreams as engineers. Since this is our first time working on a project of this scale, we can genuinely say it was a wonderful and enriching experience.

We constructed the vehicle using materials that were already available at our school, which allowed us to make the most of the resources we had. However, we also had to supplement these with some additional materials we purchased from Amazon. Every weekday, we would meet after school to work on improving the vehicle bit by bit, refining our approach as we went along.

There were definitely challenges along the way. One of the biggest difficulties we faced was not being able to find the parts we needed when we needed them, which slowed down our progress. Additionally, we didn’t have as much time as we would have liked to perfect and practice with the vehicle. Being a small team and this being our first year participating in a competition of this kind, we had a lot to learn in a short amount of time.

The materials we used included:

Pixy Cam2:
The Pixy Cam2 is a smart camera designed to recognize and track objects based on their color in real-time. Instead of sending a full image to the microcontroller, the Pixy Cam2 processes the image internally and only sends the relevant information, such as the coordinates and size of the detected object. This makes it ideal for tasks like object tracking in robotics.

Breadboard:
A breadboard is a reusable platform used for building and testing electronic circuits without soldering. It has a grid of holes where you can insert wires and components, allowing you to quickly prototype and modify circuits. Breadboards are essential for experimenting with different circuit designs.

BTN7960 Motor Driver:
The BTN7960 is a motor driver module used to control the speed and direction of DC motors. It can handle high currents, making it suitable for driving large motors. This module takes input signals from a microcontroller, like an Arduino, and translates them into the appropriate signals to control the motor.

DC Motor:
A DC motor is a type of electric motor that runs on direct current (DC) electricity. In your vehicle, the DC motor is likely used to drive the wheels, providing the necessary movement. The speed and direction of the motor are controlled by the motor driver.

10kg Servo Motor:
A servo motor is a rotary actuator that allows for precise control of angular position. The "10kg" specification refers to the torque the motor can provide, meaning it can exert a force equivalent to 10 kilograms at a given distance. Servo motors are commonly used in robotics for tasks requiring precise movement, such as steering mechanisms or arm movements.

7.4v LiPo Battery:
A 7.4v LiPo (Lithium Polymer) battery is a rechargeable battery that provides a stable and high amount of power, making it ideal for powering your vehicle. LiPo batteries are popular in robotics and remote-controlled devices because they are lightweight and can store a lot of energy relative to their size.

Switch:
A switch is a simple device used to open or close an electrical circuit. It allows you to turn the power on or off to different parts of your vehicle. In your project, the switch likely controls the main power supply, allowing you to easily start or stop the vehicle.

Button:
A button is a momentary switch that allows you to trigger an action when pressed. In your project, a button might be used to initiate a specific function, such as starting a sequence of movements or activating a sensor.

Ultrasonic Sensor:
An ultrasonic sensor measures distance by emitting sound waves and detecting the time it takes for the waves to bounce back from an object. This sensor is used to detect obstacles in front of the vehicle, helping it navigate and avoid collisions.

Arduino Mega:
The Arduino Mega is a microcontroller board that acts as the brain of your vehicle. It controls all the electronic components, like the motors, sensors, and camera, by running a program that you’ve written. The Arduino Mega is larger and has more input/output pins than other Arduino boards, making it suitable for more complex projects like your vehicle.

These materials, when combined, form the backbone of your robotic vehicle, enabling it to detect objects, navigate obstacles, and move according to the instructions programmed into the Arduino.
In this competition, our goals go beyond just having a good time and gaining valuable experience. We also aspire to advance to the nationals, where we hope to represent our beautiful country, Panama, with pride.
